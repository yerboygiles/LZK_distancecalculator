# LZK_distancecalculator
calculated distance of objects with specific math and opencv in python, but only math included, not AI. methods require the 
values maxx, minx, maxy, maxy
generated from tensorflow AI
pretty straight forward if wanting to complete on different type of system
            MinY = int(max(1, (boxes[i][0] * imageHeight)))
            MinX = int(max(1, (boxes[i][1] * imageWidth)))
            MaxY = int(min(imageHeight, (boxes[i][2] * imageHeight)))
            MaxX = int(min(imageWidth, (boxes[i][3] * imageWidth)))
